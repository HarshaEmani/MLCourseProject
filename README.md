# Machine Learning and Data Mining Course Projects
This repository contains my projects for a Machine Learning and Data Mining course, showcasing different approaches to image classification using neural networks. The repository includes two primary projects:

## MNIST Image Classification with Keras
A multiclass image classification model using Keras on the MNIST dataset. This model classifies hand-written digit images (0-9) with a Sequential neural network architecture.

### Key Features:
Sequential model with layers including Flatten, Dense (ReLU), and Dense (Softmax) for multiclass classification.
Trained to achieve high accuracy on the classic MNIST benchmark dataset.
Requirements:
TensorFlow, Keras, and NumPy.

## Binary Classification of Breast Cancer Cell Data (ANN from Scratch)
This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) from scratch for binary classification, specifically classifying diagnostic data for breast cancer cells as 'Benign (B)' or 'Malignant (M)'.

### Key Features:
Custom ANN code written without external libraries for model creation.
Utilizes techniques such as backpropagation and gradient descent.
Built to explore the inner workings of ANNs and how they perform on real-world diagnostic data.
Requirements:
Only NumPy for numerical operations.

## Getting Started
To run these projects:

Clone the repository.
Install dependencies as required (TensorFlow, Keras, and NumPy).
Open each project folder and run the respective code.
